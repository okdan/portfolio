title: I have returned to the internet

Well, I made it. It’s been quite a while since I’ve had had what one might call a “proper website for myself”. This is my attempt at it, and we’ll see how it goes.

As I find myself in the transition between campaign life and normal-person life, I’ve had the chance to take stock of what I’ve made and what it’s meant to me. I’ve tried to curate a selection of work that I’m proud of, and that I think is relevant. I’ve tried to present them as case studies, explaining my thinking and telling a story.

I really enjoyed the process of documenting my thoughts in that way, and it brought back a lot of good memories. I hope you’ll enjoy reading them and learning a little bit about what I do.

But what I’m really excited about is what this means for the future. I’m excited to talk to you about what you’re doing, and how I might be able to help you get there. Sound good? Shoot me a note: [dan@okdan.com](mailto:dan@okdan.com "Email me")
