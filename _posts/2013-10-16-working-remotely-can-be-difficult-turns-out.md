title: Working remotely can be difficult. Turns out.
---

I’ve rewritten this post from scratch three times now. This is my latest attempt at trying to capture my mess of thoughts on practicing remote product design into something coherent and useful. After trying to force clarity through formatting, I decided to just cut to the chase and use what works: The Buzzfeed Listicle!

So in hopes of synthesizing my thoughts after a few months of working remotely at a startup, I present to you:

5 Important (and 3 not-so-important) Things I’ve Learned About Working Remotely
===============================================================================

1. Distance amplifies process inefficiencies
2. Virtual interruptions are still interruptions
3. Having a 9-5 schedule in your house is the same as having a 9-5 schedule in an office (minus the commute)
4. Basecamp is far better than Asana
5. Being the only remote team member is rough
6. Comcast is terrible
7. Don’t share an office with your cat’s litter box
8. Singing aloud while working is great!

I’ll let you read into those as you will. But in all seriousness, while I have learned a lot in these past few months, it has been difficult. And though I am certainly committed to improving these difficulties, I’m starting to wonder if remote product design is possible under all circumstances. Working remotely on a small team where all other members are in the same office is very different than simply doing freelance work with semi-frequent check-ins.

So I’m trying to reconcile my desire to craft a flexible, more free-form, exciting career for myself with the hard reality of business practices. I’m still figuring out what that means.
