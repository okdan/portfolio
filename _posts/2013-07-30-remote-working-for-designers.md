title: Remote working for designers
---

Yesterday was my first day working with Change.org as a contract product designer. This is a new arrangement for me as Change.org is located in San Francisco, and I’m here in Chicago. I’ve done remote work before, but never as embedded and full-time as I will be with Change.

Remote working is becoming much more popular and accepted in the technology industry, and there are several good reasons for that. As a result, there are many great resources out there for developers and engineers looking to work remotely with teams. However as a designer, I’ve had a hard time finding similar resources related to my industry. So as I embark on this 3-month contract, I thought it might be useful to document for other designers how it goes. To reflect on what we called at the campaign, “Ups, Challenges, and Solutions.”

Follow along if that sounds interesting or useful. I will do my best to keep this current (famous last words for an amateur and infrequent blogger).
