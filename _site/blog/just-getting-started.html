			<p>My first week working remotely with Change.org has come and gone, and this seems like a natural point to do a little reflection on how things have gone so far. My first two days were spent working from home in Chicago, with the remainder of the week being spent out in San Francisco at the Change.org office. I don't anticipate to be out in San Francisco often, but since this arrangement is new for both sides we thought it worthwhile to get some face time early on.</p>

<p>Going into this, my two biggest concerns were related to developing relationships, and being at the mercy of external factors. With that first week in the barn I can say that both have, to a small degree, been an issue (mainly the latter).</p>

<p>My first day was a pretty typical one, in that I had no idea what I would be working on yet and wasn't incredibly productive. This was perhaps exacerbated by the time zone difference, as by the time the team in SF was up and running it was already after 12:00pm for me. As such, I spent most of the day just getting my tools setup and permissions squared away.</p>

<p><strong>My takeaway:</strong> to be very proactive about maintaining a prioritized task list, so I'm not dependent on people in the SF to get work done. Much more so than I might be in a more typical arrangement.</p>

<p>Day two was an improvement, although it brought forth a few other technical challenges. Google+ proved a giant headache when trying to accept an invite to a hangout, which resulted in some frustration and an awkward first introduction to my teammates. Once the meeting was underway, I had a very hard time hearing those on the other end, and oftentimes felt like they were all looking at a document or whiteboard that I couldn't see. I mostly just observed and shook a fist at Google+'s UI.</p>

<p><strong>My takeaway:</strong> Don't hesitate to speak up and clear up confusion on a video call. If I'm just a face on a laptop screen, it's easy for people to talk past me or forget I'm there.</p>

<p>A few other funny issues came up, which I hadn't anticipated. The way our home office is setup, the window is behind me. This means that when my webcam is on, a bright light is directly behind me making it impossible to see my face. I had to relocate to Amy's desk, which faces the window, in order to make myself visible.</p>

<p>I also had to relocate Henry (my cat) to the living room, because he has an innate sense of comedic timing, and he surely would have chosen the middle of the call to use the litter box or jump on the keyboard. And as laid back as everyone on the team has been so far, hearing a cat bury his crap while recapping the week's priorities isn't super desirable.</p>

<p>All in all the first two days went about as well as could be expected, all things considered. I wasn't very productive, but I did get setup on all of the various tools Change.org uses (which I think deserves it's own post), and nothing major went wrong. Unless you count having my computer hard-freeze a dozen times over the course of two hours, requiring a firmware update on my SSD. But overall, I can't complain.</p>

<p>My next post will likely cover the three days I just spent out in San Francisco with the team, and how things have begun to clarify as I settle into a more normal work routine. If you have any questions, please tweet at me <a href="http://www.twitter.com/okdan" title="Tweet at me">@okdan</a> or send me an email. This journey is a new one for me, and my hope is to be somewhat resourceful for other designers curious about remote working.</p>
