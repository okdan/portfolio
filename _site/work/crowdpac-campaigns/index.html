				<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Crowdpac's mission is to reduce the influence of big money in politics, and the best way to do that is by diversifying a candidate’s donor base through small dollar contributions. In order to make that accessible to everyone, we designed and built the first crowdfunding platform exclusively for politics. Our platform enables candidates up and down the ballot to raise funds quickly from a larger pool of donors, and build an ongoing relationship with them.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/cp_campaigns_1.png" alt="Crowdpac Campaigns" class="alignnone size-full" /></p>

<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty m-top-fifty">Early on, we identified financial uncertainty as the major issue preventing new people from running for office who are otherwise qualified. To alleviate that uncertainty, version 1.0 of our platform enabled candidates to raise conditional pledges that only convert into actual donations if you file to run. If you never run, the pledges are canceled and nobody is charged. This was a breakthrough innovation that resulted in nearly 1,000 outsider candidates running for the first time, largely from underrepresented populations.</p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty m-top-fifty">Core donation experience</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Central to the platform is an optimized, fast, frictionless donation experience. We’re constantly iterating on this flow to ensure that we’re doing right by our donors and creators. We launched with a basic form and over time added increasingly powerful features like recurring donations, saved payment methods, optional tipping, and responsive layouts.</p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty">Tip-based revenue model</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Several months into our initial launch, based on customer interviews and industry experience, we decided to modify our revenue model from a fixed percentage to an optional tip for donations. To make sure we executed this in the simplest way possible while maintaining our revenue projections, I led a prototyping effort to get the UI just right.</p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty m-top-fifty">Post-donation experience</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Because we’re trying to foster a healthier relationship between candidates and donors, the initial transaction is just the starting point. After that is where we help level them up into a full participant of the platform. Our KPIs here are accounts created, saved payment methods, endorsements made, and social sharing.</p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty m-top-fifty">Creation flow</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Just like any marketplace, both sides are equally important. So while we spend countless hours on improving our donor experience, we do the same for our campaign creators. We’ve iterated constantly to simplify the flows while reducing errors rates and customer service inquiries.</p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty m-top-fifty">Ensuring campaign success</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Similar to how the donation is only the beginning of a donor’s journey, the publishing of their campaign is only the beginning for the creator. Based on interviews and data analysis, we designed a module to help guide creators towards making their campaigns successful by encouraging them to reach important milestones and engage with their supporters.</p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty m-top-fifty">Managing your campaign</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Building a crowdfunding platform for politics is uniquely challenging due to the financial regulations involved, and it’s something we took very seriously. We made sure to provide all of the tools necessary to stay within the bounds of the law, while also having the control necessary to tell your story effectively and run a successful crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty m-top-fifty">Marketing and acquisition</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">As the sole designer for our entire platform, my responsibilities didn’t end with just the product. It naturally extended into the marketing design of our website, defining and shaping our visual brand standards, and our various user acquisition efforts around topical political events.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/cp_campaigns_13.png" alt="Crowdpac Campaigns" class="alignnone size-full" /></p>

<h2 class="project-sub-title m-bottom-twenty m-top-fifty">Contribute, communicate, iterate</h2>
<p class="project-description m-bottom-twenty">I love building products because it is a holistic practice. I think the best products come to life when it’s a collaborative effort, and I made every attempt to embody that with our engineering team. As with any startup, I was required to wear many hats. There were months where I’d be working exclusively in Sublime Edit writing HTML and CSS, managing our product roadmap, leading the QA process, or writing our internal release notes. I truly enjoy all of it.</p>
