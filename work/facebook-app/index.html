				<p><span style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-bottom:30px;">When your facebook account has 46 million fans, it presents some unique opportunities. And since we knew that two of the most important pieces of the campaign’s strategy were registering new voters and ensuring high youth vote turnout, we had to find a way to turn all of those “likes” into votes.</span></p>

<div class="one_half"><p>
The underlying functionality of our facebook app was simple &#8211; tell people whether or not they were registered to vote (if not get them started on it) and if so, tell them which of their friends in key states were not yet registered and keep bugging them until they were.</p>
</div></p>
<div class="one_half last"><p>
In order to make this possible, it required an incredible amount of work from our technology and analytics teams. My job was to outline the user flow, and to wireframe out the key touch points of the experience to ensure a level of engagement. Final visual design was done by <a href="http://ryanroche.com" title="Ryan Roche" target="_blank">Ryan Roche</a>.</p>

<div class="one_half"><p>
In order to make sure the app spread throughout people’s networks quickly, as soon as we were confident that they were registered we showed them a list of friends that we thought were not yet registered and asked them to reach out in a personal way.</p>
</div></p>
<div class="one_half last"><p>
Once a user had chosen to reach out to their friends, we gave them a dashboard to keep track of their friends’ progress through the registration process, and the tools to make sure they followed through on their commitment.</p>
