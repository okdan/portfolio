				<p><span style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-bottom:30px;">By the time the campaign reached April 4th, 2012, an incredible amount of progress had already been made. Even though there was a daunting amount left to do, we wanted to take a moment to celebrate what we had built so far and celebrate it with our supporters.</span></p>

<div class="one_half"><p>
Through the use of beautiful photography and compelling data, we were able to craft an experience telling the story of how far we had already come together.</p>
</div></p>
<div class="one_half last"><p>
Using a parallax effect, users could scroll easily through the site to see how many events had been held nationwide, how much media we had produced, and other key milestones.</p>

By interacting with the piece above, users could see a timelapse of all field office openings over time. Even though I had been in the middle of it all, it was compelling to watch unfold.</p>

<span style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-bottom:40px;">By using photographs of our diverse volunteers and supporters, we reflected the fact that our campaign was truly a grassroots effort. As the President likes to say, bottom-up instead of top-down.</span></p>

<span style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-bottom:40px;">Oh, and we designed and built the site from scratch in the span of 3 (very long) days.</span></p>
