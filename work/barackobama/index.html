				<p><span style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-bottom:30px;">As one of the highest trafficked websites on the internet, BarackObama.com served simultaneously as the messaging outlet, fundraising platform, and public face of the entire camapaign. I was lucky to be one person among dozens who were responsible for this incredibly important product.</span></p>

Built as a fully responsive website, the first of it’s kind in politics, the campaign’s website was constantly iterated on from it’s launch in December 2011 through Election Day 2012. Our main goal was to represent the President in an accurate and positive light, giving our supporters and potential supporters a way to interface with the campaign.</p>
</div>
<div class="one_half last"><p>
We did this through our Digital Team, the largest and best in history, producing incredible amounts of content, and engaging on every platform available to us. It was a true honor to represent the President in this way, and to continually push the envelope alongside the most talented people I’ve ever worked with.</p>

<div class="two_third"><p>
Throughout the course of the campaign, we were constantly experimenting with creative ways to engage with our supporters.  Because of our technology infrastructure, we were able to use data in ways that were previously impossible. Above is an example of where we were able to introduce an element of competition to drive action.</p>

<div class="one_half"><p>
Issue pages were some of our most popular pages. We used that as an opportunity to rethink the way we talked about our platform. Instead of a standard text-heavy template, we instead leveraged our interactive assets and went with a more visual and narrative-driven approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="one_half last"><p>
One of those assets was our “interactive jobs chart,” perhaps the most recognizable symbol of the recent economic recovery. Along with frontend developer <a href="http://www.number61.net/" title="Matt Gipp" target="_blank">Matt Gipp</a>, we created a fully respsonsive jobs chart, highlighting key economic milestones through the administration’s first term.</p>
