				<p class="project-description m-bottom-fifty">Shortly after I joined the early team at Crowdpac as the Lead Designer, we decided to pivot from being an voter information site to a political action site. Our mission is to reduce the influence of big money in politics, and we asserted that the best way to do that was to broaden each candidate’s fundraising base through smaller dollar donations. Combined with the mechanics of crowdfunding this enabled small, unknown candidates to quickly raise funds while also building an ongoing relationship with their supporters.</p>

<div class="two_third"><p>
After leading a research phase with customers and experts, we identified the financial uncertainty involved in running for office as a major roadblock for political novices who may otherwise be totally qualified to run. So we built a feature that enabled candidates to raise conditional pledges that only convert into actual donations to your campaign if you file to run for office. If you never run, the pledges are canceled and nobody is charged. It’s the first time this has ever been done, and to date has been utilized by nearly 1,000 candidates raising several million dollars, bring a more diverse set of people into the political process, mostly outsiders.

Kathryn Allen was a doctor who was so dissapointed by her Representative's position on healthcare that she explored a run for Congress. She raised hundreds of thousands of dollars before officially filing as a candidate for the 3rd district. DeRay used his passion for his home city of Baltimore and his social networks to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to power his run for Mayor.</span></p>
