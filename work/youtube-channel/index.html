				<p class="project-description">At a time when digital video production is becoming an increasingly important part of any campaign, the campaign decided to design and build a custom Youtube Channel that was tailored specifically to our needs and unique in the world of politics.</p>
<p><span class="project-roles">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="one_half"><p class="project-segment-description">
Modeled after the home page of BarackObama.com, the Youtube Channel included five interchangeable “feature tiles” that were swapped in and out frequently. The architecture of the channel also included custom programming around Issues, Promises Kept, and documentary pieces from all around the country.</p>
</div>
<div class="one_half last"><p class="project-segment-description">
Visitors could sort content chronologically, by popularity, and other factors. At the peak of the campaign, OFA was producing many dozens of videos per week. The ability to house all of that content and make it available to our supporters outside of the traditional television model was an incredible strategic advantage.</p>

<div class="two_third"><p class="project-segment-description">
The “Our Story” section of the channel highlighted important videos dating all the way back to 2007. This was a key element of the site, giving our supporters a way to relive and celebrate emotional moments and highlights from our journey together.</p>

<div class="two_third"><p class="project-segment-description">
Alongside each video player was something we called the “Take Action Box”. Depending on the content of each individual video, we were able to deliver a customized message and call to action. That could be a sign-up ask, a donation ask, or a social ask to share the video content with specific friends on Facebook.</p>
