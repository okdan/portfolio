				<p><span style="display:block;text-align:center;margin-bottom:30px;">Back when WWII games were all the rage, Ubisoft released their entry into the market with a compelling title based on a real-life campaign in the war. While at POP, we designed an immersive experience to highlight the characters and story of the game.</span></p>

Complete with paratroopers in the background, a trumpet-and-snare soundtrack, and explosions in the sky, people visiting the site were immediately given the feel of what the game would be like. Alongside game information, users were also able to learn about Operation Market Garden.</p>

Parallel with the release of the game, Ubisoft released a book written by an historian about the same operation that Brothers in Arms was based upon. We took great care to bring life to the characters, and treat the subject matter appropriately.</p>

A sample of screens from the site, where users could learn about available weapons and game characters. One of my favorite parts was the timeline, where you could step day-by-day through Operation Market Garden and watch historical video footage.</p>
